## Scope

The following must be included in the project:

- Products page
- Page showing information about an individual product
- Accounts
- Shopping bag
- Checkout

A filtering feature is not necessary in the app because the company only sells chocolate bars and they are all the same price.

## Business model

The business is a B2C (business to consumer) ecommerce business selling luxury handmade chocolate bars made from ethically sourced ingredients. The products are only sold online. Customers choose a bar or bars on the business website. The bars they choose are added to their shopping bag. They can edit the amount of bars in the shopping bag. When they decide to make a purchase they can easily do so on the website with the help of Stripe. Once they have made a purchase they receive a confirmation email. The product is then sent out to them. The aims of the ecommerce website are to inform visitors about the range of chocolate bars for sale, to maximise sales and to make it easy for people to make a purchase.

CORE BUSINESS INTENTS

The business owner wants to make a profit selling luxury handmade chocolate bars made from ethically sourced ingredients. 

TARGET AUDIENCE

The target audience are chocolate lovers who want luxury handmade chocolate bars. The target audience also includes people who want to buy some luxury chocolate
as a gift for someone.

MARKETING STRATEGY

The business regularly engages with customers by holding product tasting events and having an email newsletter. The business offers free delivery after a customer spends over a certain amount of money on an order. The business also has a Facebook page that they can use to build up awareness of the business and where they can connect with customers and potential customers.

### Bugs

There are no current bugs in the project.

These are some of the bugs that occurred during the development of the project:

- The font for the logo wasn't showing up. This was solved by adding links in the <head></head> section of the html file.

- The css file had an error in it. This was solved by removing the font import from the base.css.

- The menu button wasn't showing up. This was solved by editing the css.

- The products are not showing up on the products page.

- The login page was not working. This was solved by editing login.html.

- The buttons for adding and subtracting items from shopping bag were not working. This has been solved.

- The padlock sign was not on the buttons. This was solved by editing the css.

- The reviews were not showing up on the product_details page. This was solved by changing the for loop.

- The buttons for deleting and editing reviews where in the wrong place but that has been solved now.

- The contact form and the attendance form were not emptying once the form had been submitted. This has now been solved by editing the views.
