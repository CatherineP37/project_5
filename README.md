[Deployed website](https://p-5-bf8a9d578875.herokuapp.com/)

## Scope

The following must be included in the project:

- Products page
- Page showing information about an individual product
- Accounts
- Shopping bag
- Checkout

A filtering feature is not necessary in the app because the company only sells chocolate bars and they are all the same price.

## Marketing

The business is a B2C business that regularly engages with customers by holding product tasting events and having an email newsletter.

The business offers free delivery after a customer spends over a certain amount of money on an order. The business will also have a Facebook page and an email newsletter
that users can sign up to.

### Manual Testing

As I went through the project I manually tested each user story thoroughly. I tested the views, 
the models, the booking form and the authentication. The user can create an account so that they
can log in. They can log in with their details. They can view the appointments that they've
already booked and they can update or delete the bookings. They can use the booking form to book
an appointment and they can choose from a list of available appointments.
